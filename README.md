#Portfolio Page

##About

This is the first website which I ever created from scratch. Adhering to the information from the first two weeks of class, I created this “mock portfolio page”, illuminating the structural basics of web design. 

At the time of writing this, I do not know much about web development, but in knowing that this is beginner level stuff, I know that this page will act as a great benchmark to scale my future success.

##Installation

Download the code and execute accordingly

##Features and room for improvement

Flexy website, can we viewed on multiple devices without any interference. Navigation bar… aha.. this navigation bar is finally done with for this project. As you will see in the CSS sheet I have.. a lot of scrap notes relating to this towards the bottom of the sheet. This is to be ignored as indicated by the markings. Furthermore, this website does display two interactive links in the nav bar. These links which I cannot manipulate to my liking. 

(Ideally : I would like for the nav bar text to remain default at bay. But, when the cursor hovers over one of the four links, I would like for the selected link, 1/4, to be highlighted to the hover text color value, and the other links, 3/4, to ALSO have the hover effect applied. Even though the cursor isn't hovering over them, only the one.)

Thus, the trash can of stockpile of notes on the CSS page.
