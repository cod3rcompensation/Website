    <p>Hello, my name is Ellie Jane, I currently work at Amazon and am looking for another part-time job. Last Christmas season was my first as one of “Santa’s Elves”delivering packages. I can say the that work load was surprisingly immense, ten boxes per doorstep sometimes, seemingly, half of the gifts for under the Christmas tree. It was an honor to play a part in putting on some families holiday celebrations. There is nothing like “delivering smiles". Not only is this applicable to Amazon (known for the two-day prime delivery smile) but also to my other work experiences like serving in the restaurant industry. I really love servicing people and working machinery. When I am not at work, I am either studying or cleaning.</p>
